# Course and Project Overview
Udacity Nanodegree Intro to Self Driving Cars

### Course 1: Bayesian Thinking
In this course, you will learn a mathematical framework known as Bayesian Inference. This is the same
framework that underlies a self-driving car’s understanding of itself and the world around it. It’s what
allows a car to use unreliable sensor data to achieve surprisingly accurate estimates of its own location in
the world (known as localization). It also underlies the tracking algorithms that self-driving cars use to
predict what other traffic on the road will do in the future. By the end of this course you will not only
understand Bayesian Inference, you will be able to see the world the way a self-driving car does.

#### Course Project: Joy Ride
Jump into writing code that controls a simulated vehicle. Send throttle and steering commands to the car to try and get it to
navigate around a test track.

#### Course Project: 2D Histogram Filter in Python
In this first project, you will write the `sense` and `move` functions for a 2-dimensional histogram filter in Python.

### Course 2: Working with Matrices
This course will focus on two tools which are vital to self-driving car engineers: object oriented programming and linear algebra.
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is an approach to programming that is especially useful when the things we are modeling in our 
code have obvious real-world counterparts (as is often the case when writing code for something as real as a car). In this course you’ll learn the basics of OOP with a focus on how to use classes which others have created.
Linear Algebra is the mathematics of matrices. For our purposes in this course we will treat it as a tool.
The main goal will be to gain a basic proficiency with this powerful tool by making the notation of linear
algebra approachable and understandable. With this tool in hand you’ll be able to implement any of the
numerous algorithms you’ll encounter as you continue your self driving car career (including the
ubiquitous Kalman Filter).
The goal of this course is very pragmatic: by the end you will know how to use the tools— deeper
theoretical understanding is something you will acquire gradually as you continue your journey through
this Nanodegree program, and the rest of your career.

#### Course Project: Implement a Matrix Class
In this project you’ll practice using your object oriented programming and matrix math skills by filling out
the methods in a partially-completed `Matrix` class.

### Course 3: Performance Programming in C++
C++ is the language of self-driving cars, and code written in this language can run incredibly fast. This
course will be the first step in a long and rewarding journey towards C++ expertise. In this course, you 
will start to explore how to write good code that runs correctly. We’ll focus primarily on the low level
language features of C++ which can make C++ fast, but we’ll also discuss other best practices as well.

#### Course Project: 2D Histogram Filter in C++
In this project you’ll translate the Histogram Filter code you wrote earlier in Python into C++

#### Course Project: Performant C++
A self-driving car can’t afford to waste any cycles or memory
unnecessarily. In this project you’ll take some functioning (but
inefficient) C++ code and optimize it.

### Course 4: Navigating Complex Data Structures
What data structure should I use to model this relationship? What algorithm will accomplish that goal?
These are the questions that self-driving car engineers think about on a daily basis. Algorithmic thinking is
a skill you’ll continue to refine throughout your programming career. In this course you’ll focus on some of
the data structures and algorithms that show up most frequently in self-driving cars.

#### Course Project: Planning an Optimal Path
You turn on your self-driving car, buckle up, and enter a destination.
Navigating from A B is not an easy problem. In this project you’ll use
your knowledge of data structures (in particular, graph data
structures) and search algorithms to write an algorithm which uses a
map and traffic information to find the quickest route between two
points.

### Course 5: Visualizing Calculus and Vehicle Motion and Controls
It’s sometimes convenient to represent the world as a discrete grid of cells. But that isn’t quite right. And
when it comes time to actually issue control commands about steering, throttle, and braking we have to
stop pretending the world is discrete because, in reality, the world is continuous.
In this course, you’ll learn the basics of calculus, the mathematics of continuity. To visualize the
continuous trajectories of the real-world you’ll also learn to use some of Python’s most popular
visualization libraries.

#### Course Project (optional): Trajectory Visualizer
As a self-driving car engineer, a lot of the code you write involves
simulation, visualization, testing, and debugging. In this project you’ll
write a visualization tool that will let you visualize the continuous
trajectories that come from various search and control algorithms.

### Course 6: Machine Learning and Computer Vision
How do you teach a computer the difference between a photo of a car and a photo of a human? As
humans we can make the distinction without trying, but teaching this intuition to a computer is much more
work. In this course, you’ll learn how a computer sees an image and how we can use machine learning to
teach a computer to identify images programmatically.

#### Course Project: Image Classifier from Scratch
In this project you’ll build an image classifier from scratch. When you’re done you’ll have an algorithm that 
can reliably classify an image as “pedestrian” or “car.
